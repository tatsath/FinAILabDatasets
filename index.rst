FinAILab's Datasets! - Free Financial data for building AI and Machine Learning in Finance
===========================================================

Welcome to the Documentation for `FinAILab Dataset <http://finailab.com/all-datasets/>`_.
This documentation contains the information about the **Free financial dataset** for thousands
of asset classes, macroeconomic data, fundamentals and alternative data that can be used for building models on `FinAILab <http://finailab.com/>`_.


Getting the Data is the most critical and most expensive part when working on machine learning models in Finance.
However, in 95% of all cases where Finance Professionals or Researchers require Financial Data, it can actually be obtained from Free or low-priced web sources.
Some of them provide powerful APIs and Python wrapper packages, which makes it easy and comfortable to import the data with and into Python.

+++ This doumentation shows you how to get massive amounts of Financial Data and explains in detail how to install required Libraries and how to download and import the data with few lines of Python Code +++

The data covered in this documentation include:
--------------------------------------
- Historical Price and Volume Data for thousands of Stocks, Indexes, Mutual Funds and ETFs
- Data of macroeconomic variables
- 60+ Exchanges all around the world
- 120,000+ Symbols/Instruments
- Foreign Exchange (FOREX): 150+ Physical Currencies / Currency Pairs
- 500+ Digital- / Cryptocurrencies
- Fundamentals, Ratings, Historical Prices and Yields for Corporate Bonds
- Commodities (Crude Oil, Gold, Silver, etc.)
- Stock Options for 4,500 US Stocks
- Fundamentals, Metrics and Ratios for thousands of Stocks, Indexes, Mutual Funds and ETFs
- Balance Sheets
- Profit and Loss Statements (P&L)
- Cashflow Statements
- 50+ Technical Indicators (e.g. SMA, Bollinger Bands)
- Real-time and Historical Data (back to 1960s)
- Streaming high-frequency real-time Data
- Stock Splits and Dividends and how these are reflected in Stock Prices
â€¦ and use appropriately adjusted data for your tasks! (avoid the Pitfalls!)
